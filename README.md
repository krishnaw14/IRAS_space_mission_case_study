# IRAS space mission case study
AE 240 - Course Project

Case study of the 1983 space mission. 

Launch Vehicle: Delta 3910
Spacecraft: IRAS

The project includes looking up the mission, extracting the orbit parameters of the Launch vehicle and spacecraft, designing the trajectory of launch vehicles and orbital manoeuvre undergone by the spacecraft and finally end to end simulation for the complete trajectory.

The simulations have been made in MATLAB, the plots have been made in python and the report has been made in LaTeX. The relevant references have been mentioned in the report.

MATLAB simulation is adapted from [deedy's repository](https://github.com/deedy/Satellite-Orbit-Simulation) of the same name as the folder uploaded in my repository.
